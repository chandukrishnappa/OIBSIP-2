#Let’s see if this dataset contains missing values or not:

#While analyzing the missing values, It was found that the column names are not correct. So, for a better understanding of this data, we will rename all the columns:

data.columns= ["States","Date","Frequency",
               "Estimated Unemployment Rate",
               "Estimated Employed",
               "Estimated Labour Participation Rate",
               "Region","longitude","latitude"]
#Now let’s have a look at the correlation between the features of this dataset:

plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(data.corr())
plt.show()
<ipython-input-5-326ee88c8202>:3: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The seaborn styles shipped by Matplotlib are deprecated since 3.6, as they no longer correspond to the styles shipped by seaborn. However, they will remain available as 'seaborn-v0_8-<style>'. Alternatively, directly use the seaborn API instead.
  plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')

Unemployment Rate Analysis: Data Visualization
Now let’s visualize the data to analyze the unemployment rate. We will first take a look at the estimated number of employees according to different regions of India:

data.columns= ["States","Date","Frequency",
               "Estimated Unemployment Rate","Estimated Employed",
               "Estimated Labour Participation Rate","Region",
               "longitude","latitude"]
plt.title("Indian Unemployment")
sns.histplot(x="Estimated Employed", hue="Region", data=data)
plt.show()

#Now let’s see the unemployment rate according to different regions of India:

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
plt.title("Indian Unemployment")
sns.histplot(x="Estimated Unemployment Rate", hue="Region", data=data)
plt.show()

#Now let’s create a dashboard to analyze the unemployment rate of each Indian state by region. For this, we’ll use a sunburst plot:

unemploment = data[["States", "Region", "Estimated Unemployment Rate"]]
figure = px.sunburst(unemploment, path=["Region", "States"], 
                     values="Estimated Unemployment Rate", 
                     width=700, height=700, color_continuous_scale="RdY1Gn", 
                     title="Unemployment Rate in India")
figure.show()
